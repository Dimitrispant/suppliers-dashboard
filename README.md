ðŸ“š Overview
This repository contains:

Power BI Dashboard: A dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as EuroCost, ServiceType usage trends, and institutional preferences using Power BI.
Machine Learning Models:
Classification: Predict the ServiceType using features like SupplierID, OIPID, InstitutionName, and Country.
Time Series Forecasting: Forecast EuroCost trends using models like ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing.
ðŸš€ Features
